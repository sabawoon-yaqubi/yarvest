Pyrah's Pioneer Peak Farm - vegetables,"Comments from a visitor on July 27, 2014: ""I stopped going to Pyrah's several years ago when I encountered a sign saying we could not go anywhere near a specific area because it had just been sprayed with pesticides. I recently emailed them to see if they had stopped using the pesticides, but they never responded. I was finally able to get someone to answer the phone after several calls. The girl I spoke to said ""no we are not organic and yes we do use pesticides"". I just don't believe the chemicals and pesticides somehow miraculously disappear from fruits and vegetables when they hit your table. This is a big concern to my family and we always do our best to buy organic only.""",,,,"Comments from a visitor on July 27, 2014: ""I stopped going to Pyrah's several years ago when I encountered a sign saying we could not go anywhere near a specific area because it had just been sprayed with pesticides.
